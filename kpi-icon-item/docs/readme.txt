KPI Icon Plugin
===============

This is an item plugin used to display a simple Key Performance Indicator (KPI) icon.

The icon is displayed using Font Awesome (bundled with Apex).

You can set the threshold values for green and red (and everything in-between will be yellow). Also, you choose whether high values are good or bad.

Since the item itself is a regular Apex item, you can assign a value to it using a computation, process, PL/SQL expression, etc.
